# Problems/Solutions
  Rendering the Google Maps quite difficult as there were a few ways to render it. Many hours were spent to correctly render the map to     specificly view San Francisco on the default loadup. Studying of the Google Maps API enabled a better understanding of how it can be       used.
  
# Accomplishments
  Map was abled to be rendered with full functionality of zoom in/out as well as drop a pin location.

# Future Plans
  I would like to further progress and complete the app to have all the fucntions I would like it it to have such as:
  * create user login
  * save favorite Trucks to users
  * better Front-End Designs
